<p>Hello there! I am Shaily, a Research Associate at the <a href="https://lcs2.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Laboratory for Computational Social Systems</a>, a multi-institute lab in collaboration with IIT-Delhi and IIIT-Delhi, where I am advised by <a href="https://tanmoychak.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> and <a href="http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~shad.akhtar/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Md. Shad Akhtar</a>. My broad area of work revolves around AI for Combating Online Hate. Since August 2022, I have been leading the project sponsored by <a href="https://www.logically.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Logically.ai(UK)</a> exploring the available data and methods to counter Hate Speech on social media.</p>

<p>Being a novice researcher, my interests are to explore AI and its applications for Social Good, and to explore low-resource computational implications on the performance of Large Language Models.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree from Pune University in 2022, prior to which I was part of a few research projects with Prof. Manisha Marathe in the domain of Sentiment Analysis and Neural Machine Translation.</p>

<p>Among other hobbies, I have been an avid guitarist for the past six years, love Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, and possess a deep appreciation for chai.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out to me via Email or LinkedIn!</p>

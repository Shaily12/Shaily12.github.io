Hello there! I am Shaily. I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree from Pune University in 2022, and have been lucky enough to explore my passion in the field of Natural Language Processing since. My primary area of work as a research associate in collaboration with IIT-Delhi and IIIT-Delhi is AI for Combating Online Hate. Since August 2022, I have been leading the project sponsored by Logically.ai(UK) exploring the available data and methods to counter Hate Speech on social media. 

This is my [publications page](/Shaily12.github.io/publications/).

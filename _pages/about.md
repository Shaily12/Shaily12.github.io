Hello there! I am Shaily, a Research Associate at the [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems](https://lcs2.in/), a multi-institute lab in collaboration with IIT-Delhi and IIIT-Delhi, where I am advised by Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty and Dr. Md. Shad Akhtar. My broad area of work is AI for Combating Online Hate. Since August 2022, I have been leading the project sponsored by [Logically.ai(UK)](https://www.logically.ai/) exploring the available data and methods to counter Hate Speech on social media.
 
I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree from Pune University in 2022, prior to which I was part of a few research projects with Prof. Manisha Marathe at PVGCOET.

This is my [publications page](/Shaily12.github.io/publications/).

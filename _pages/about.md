Hello there! I am Shaily Desai, a Research Intern at the University of Michigan School of Information, working with [Dr. Joyojeet Pal](https://joyojeet.people.si.umich.edu) on analysis of political Twitter data - more specifically, to what extent do politically leaning influencers benefit from their affiliation to pro-Govt or pro-Opposition parties. 

Prior to this, I was a Researcher at the [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems](https://lcs2.in/), a multi-institute lab in collaboration with IIT-Delhi and IIIT-Delhi, where I was advised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) and [Dr. Md. Shad Akhtar](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~shad.akhtar/). My broad area of work revolved around AI for Combating Online Hate. From August 2022-June 2023, I led the project sponsored by [Logically.ai(UK)](https://www.logically.ai/) exploring the available data and methods to counter Hate Speech on social media. My team and I came up with a novel methodology to generate Intent-Conditioned counterspeech, and I also worked on Emotional Counterspeech Generation, advising a BTech student in their bachelor thesis.

Being a novice researcher, my interests are to explore AI and its applications for Social Good, and to explore low-resource computational implications on the performance of Large Language Models. 
 
I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree from Pune University in 2022, prior to which I was part of a few research projects with Prof. Manisha Marathe in the domain of Sentiment Analysis and Neural Machine Translation. Head to my [publications](/publications/) page for a list of my research work(does not contain one paper under review).

Among other hobbies, I have been an avid guitarist for the past eight years, love Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, and possess a deep appreciation for chai. 

Feel free to reach out to me via Email or LinkedIn!
